== Kolorize

Are you tried of straining your eyes to find important lines in your log output?  Do you think your "SYSTEM EXPLODED" messages should stand out a bit from the rest of your log lines?

Well, here's a gem for colorizing your console output.  Basically it just wraps your text in Unixy escape sequences.  It's also easy to use and doesn't modify the String class.

For example, if you want to make a line red, use Kolorize.red("SYSTEM EXPLODED").  It also supports green and bold via the, wait for it, green and bold methods.

Feel free to fork and add more.  I will as the need arises too.
